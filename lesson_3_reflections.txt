* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When collaborating with someone or if need access to work from different computers.

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because there are might be a conflicts in the data.

* Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Clone is a copy of repository. We can use it when we want to copy a repository from local to local or from github to local.
  Fork is the same as clone, but it's used on the GitHub. We use it when we need to copy someone's repository from GitHub to our GitHub account. 
  Branch is sequence of commits that have parent-child relationship. We can use branches when we want to make i.e. experimental changes that will not affect the current state.

* What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- You can work without internet.
  You can make changes and don't worry that it will affect the remote repository.
  If there are several collaborators it is better when each have local copy of remote repository than everyone would work directly with remote repository. It'll be easier to manage conflicts.

* How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
- I would devide the project into independet modules and distribute them between
  collaborators. 
  I think it would be easier to combine all work together and get the final
  product.
  But it would be harder to plan and manage all work.

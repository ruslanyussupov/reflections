* How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
- By compairing last worked version with the current containing the bug we can see where we made mistake.

* How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- If we made bad updates with errors and bugs we can easy return to the last worked state.
  Also we can easy add and cancel features by switching versions.

* What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- pros
  you can logicaly separate commits, so it will be easy to find and use a commit you need
  cons
  you can loose some data, that you didn't commit in time

* Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
- Because in Git we save files manually.
